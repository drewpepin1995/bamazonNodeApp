## About the App
Bamazon pulls data from a mysql database, that stores product information for an online store. The app gives you the option to purchase products from the database after viewing the item list and costs of each product. After choosing which product, you can then choose how much of the product you'd like to buy, and will be given a total cost based on your choices. 

## How to use
